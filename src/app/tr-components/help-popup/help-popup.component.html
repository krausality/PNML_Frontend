        <p>In Build mode you can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Build a new petri net from scratch.</li>
            <li>Modify an existing petri net.</li>
            <li>
                Load a petri net from file with drag and drop into the canvas
                area (supported file formats: pnml, json).
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            For most actions, you activate the appropriate action mode by
            selecting the corresponding button. While the mode is activated
            (button is highlighted in red) you can perform the actions belonging
            to this mode. A few buttons will directly perform the action
            ('Delete all' and layout buttons) or open a popup window ('Edit
            actions').

                    For the purpose of drawing the petri net, nodes repel each
                    other while arcs are implemented to act like springs,
                    applying directional forces based on being stretched or
                    compressed. The forces generated are calculated in an
                    iterative procedure. Each iteration is comprised of the
                    following steps:

                        A force vector is calculated for each node. This force
                        vector is composed of the sum of the repulsive forces
                        from all other nodes in the petri net and the spring

                    <li>
                        Each individual node is then assigned to a layer by an
                        implementation of the Longest Path Algorithm proposed by
                        Tamassia et al.

                        The nodes are then ordered to minimize arc crossings

                    Pressing this button will calculate place invariants with
                    the Farkas algorithm. A popup window will appear with the
                    results of the calculation. It presents a table where each

                <p>
                    The results of the Farkas algorithm contain all minimal
                    place invariants, but they may also contain additional place
                    invariants that are non-minimal. If you want to exclusively
                    calculate minimal place invariants, use the next calculation

                    The removal of non-minimal place invariants is implemented

            After either of the calculations, all places that are part of the
            support of one or several of the calculated place invariants are
            highlighted in blue. These places are then also part of the support
            of the LC place invariant that results from linear combination (LC)
            of all result place invariants. The non-zero values of this LC place
            invariant are shown as factors with the place ids in the petri net
            graph.
        </p>

        <h2>Place invariants for a specific place</h2>
        <p>
            After the calculation of place invariants, you may see the place
            invariants that have a specific place in their support by clicking
            on that place in the petri net graph. The place invariants for a
            specific place may contain both place invariants that have been
            selected or deselected for the linear combination (see below). Those
            that are included in the current linear combination are highlighted
            in blue, those that have been deselected are highlighted in white.
        </p>

        <h2>Linear Combination</h2>
        <p>
            With the 'Linear Combination' functionality you have the option, to
            further inspect the results of the calculation by selecting specific
            place invariants (or just one) for linear combination. The resulting
            LC place invariant is shown above the table as an equation together
            with its value. It is also shown in the petri net graph as blue
            highlighted places together with the values of the LC place
            invariant as factors with the place ids.

                    or deselect place invariants in any combination by clicking
                    the respective table rows. Selected place invariants are
